### Python Package Installations (pip)

---

## 🐍 What is `pip`?

Think of `pip` like the **Google Play Store** for Python. It helps you:

* 📦 Install Python libraries
* 🧹 Uninstall them
* 📋 List what you have
* 📁 Save and reuse your environment

---

## ✅ 1. `pip install packagename`

**👉 What it does:** Installs a Python library.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip install requests
```

➡️ This installs the **`requests`** library, which helps you make HTTP requests (like visiting websites using Python).

**🎯 To install a specific version:**

```bash
pip install requests==2.28.1
```

---

## ✅ 2. `pip uninstall packagename`

**👉 What it does:** Uninstalls a library.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip uninstall requests
```

It asks for confirmation. To skip that:

```bash
pip uninstall -y requests
```

---

## ✅ 3. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

**👉 What it does:** Saves a list of all installed packages (with versions) into a file.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This creates a file like:

```
requests==2.28.1
numpy==1.24.3
```

**💡 Why?** So others can install the **same environment**.

---

## ✅ 4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**👉 What it does:** Installs all packages from a `requirements.txt` file.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

➡️ It reads the file and installs everything — great when setting up a new project.

---

## ✅ 5. `pip list`

**👉 What it does:** Shows all installed Python packages.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip list
```

**Output:**

```
Package    Version
--------   -------
requests   2.28.1
numpy      1.24.3
```

---

## ✅ 6. `pip show packagename`

**👉 What it does:** Shows detailed info about a specific package.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip show requests
```

**Output:**

```
Name: requests
Version: 2.28.1
Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages
Requires: idna, certifi, urllib3
```

➡️ Useful to check **where it’s installed**, what it depends on, etc.

---

## ✅ 7. `pip install --user packagename`

**👉 What it does:** Installs a package **just for your user**, not for the whole system.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
pip install --user numpy
```

**💡 Why?**

* You don’t need admin/root access.
* It doesn’t affect other users or system Python.

---

## 📦 Bonus: Using a **Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

To avoid breaking your system or mixing packages, use a virtual environment:

**🔹 Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv env
```

**🔹 Activate it (Linux/Mac):**

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

**🔹 Activate it (Windows):**

```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

Then use `pip` normally inside that environment.

| Command                           | What It Does                               | Example                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `pip install requests`            | Install a package                          | Install `requests`              |
| `pip uninstall requests`          | Uninstall a package                        | Remove `requests`               |
| `pip freeze > requirements.txt`   | Save all installed packages to a file      | Save your current environment   |
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Install from a requirements file           | Setup from another project      |
| `pip list`                        | Show installed packages                    | See what’s installed            |
| `pip show requests`               | See details about a specific package       | Version, location, dependencies |
| `pip install --user numpy`        | Install for only current user (not system) | No `sudo` needed                |

---

## ✅ Good Practices

* Always use **virtual environments** (`venv`) for projects.
* Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to track your project’s libraries.
* Upgrade pip when needed:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
