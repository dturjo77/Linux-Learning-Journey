## ⚙️ Linux Command Execution, History, and Session Tools – Made Simple

These tools help you **run**, **control**, and **track commands**, and **manage terminal sessions** more efficiently.

---

### 1. **`command1 ; command2`** → Run both commands, no matter what

📌 Runs `command2` even if `command1` fails.

✅ Example:

```bash
ls ; echo "Done"
```

➡️ Lists files, then prints “Done”.

---

### 2. **`command1 && command2`** → Run `command2` *only if* `command1` succeeds

📌 Checks if `command1` worked before running the next.

✅ Example:

```bash
mkdir mydir && cd mydir
```

➡️ Only changes directory if `mkdir` succeeds.

---

### 3. **`command1 || command2`** → Run `command2` *only if* `command1` fails

📌 A fallback: run second command on failure.

✅ Example:

```bash
ping -c 1 google.com || echo "No internet"
```

➡️ If ping fails, prints an error message.

---

### 4. **`command &`** → Run in background

📌 Frees up your terminal.

✅ Example:

```bash
firefox &
```

➡️ Firefox opens, but you still have a usable terminal.

🛠️ Use `jobs` to list background tasks, `fg` to bring them back.

---

### 5. **`history`** → See past commands

📌 Lists your command history with numbers.

✅ Example:

```bash
history
!1024  # Runs command number 1024
```

🛠️ Use `history -c` to clear it, or add `HISTSIZE=1000` in `.bashrc` to set size.

---

### 6. **`watch command`** → Run a command repeatedly

📌 Good for live monitoring.

✅ Example:

```bash
watch -n 5 df -h
```

➡️ Updates disk space every 5 seconds.

Other ideas:

* `watch date` → live clock
* `watch ls -l` → track file changes

---

### 7. **`tmux`** → Advanced terminal session manager

📌 Lets you split terminal windows, run persistent sessions, and reconnect after logout.

✅ Start a session:

```bash
tmux
```

💡 Shortcuts:

* `Ctrl+b %` → Split vertically
* `Ctrl+b d` → Detach
* `tmux attach` → Reconnect

✅ Perfect for SSH users or multitasking in one terminal.

---

### 8. **`screen`** → Simpler alternative to `tmux`

📌 Keeps terminal sessions running in background.

✅ Start:

```bash
screen
```

💡 Controls:

* `Ctrl+a d` → Detach
* `screen -r` → Reattach
* `screen -ls` → List sessions

🛠️ Good for long-running scripts (e.g., `python script.py`) on remote servers.
