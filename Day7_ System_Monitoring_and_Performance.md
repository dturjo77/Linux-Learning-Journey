System Monitoring Commands ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the world of system monitoring! These commands are like magic tools ðŸª„ that let you peek inside your computer to see how itâ€™s doing. Imagine your computer as a busy toy factory, and these tools help you check how fast the workers (CPU), storage (disks), and machines (memory) are working. Each section below explains a command, its options (flags), and fun examples to make it super easy to understand, even for a 10-year-old! Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€

Tips and Tricks


1. iostat
What it does: iostat is like a doctor checking your computerâ€™s heart (CPU) and how fast itâ€™s moving toys (data) to and from the storage (disk). It shows how busy your CPU is and how much reading/writing your disk is doing.
How to Use
Run this to see basic CPU and disk stats:
iostat

Example Output
Linux 5.15.0-73-generic (my-laptop) 07/15/2025

avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
          10.20    0.00    2.30    0.50    0.00   87.00

Device:            tps    kB_read/s    kB_wrtn/s    kB_read    kB_wrtn
sda               5.00      100.50       50.25     1005000     502500


CPU: %user (10.2%) means programs are using 10.2% of the CPU. %idle (87%) means the CPU is relaxing.
Disk: sda (your hard drive) reads 100.5 KB per second and writes 50.25 KB per second.

Flags



Flag
Description



-c
Show only CPU stats (skip disk).


-d
Show only disk stats (skip CPU).


-x
Show detailed stats (like disk usage percentage).


<interval> <count>
Update every <interval> seconds, <count> times (e.g., 1 3 for 1 second, 3 updates).


More Examples

Check every 2 seconds, 3 times:
iostat 2 3

This updates CPU and disk stats every 2 seconds, 3 times.

Show detailed disk stats:
iostat -x -d

Output:
Device:  rrqm/s   wrqm/s   r/s   w/s   rkB/s   wkB/s   %util
sda       0.00     0.00   2.50  1.50  80.00   40.00    5.20

%util shows the disk is only 5.2% busy.



Note: You might need sudo for detailed stats. Install with sudo apt install sysstat (Ubuntu).


2. vmstat
What it does: vmstat is like a spy watching your computerâ€™s workers (processes), toy storage (memory), and delivery trucks (disks). It shows how many processes are waiting, how much memory is free, and disk activity.
How to Use
Run this for a quick snapshot:
vmstat

Example Output
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ------cpu-----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 1  0      0  800000 100000 200000    0    0    50    25  100  200 10  5 80  5  0


r: 1 process is ready to run.
free: 800,000 KB (~800 MB) of free memory.
us/sy/id: CPU usage (10% user, 5% system, 80% idle).

Flags

Description



-s

<interval> <count>
Update every <interval> seconds, <count> times.


More Examples

Update every 3 seconds, 4 times:
vmstat 3 4

Shows how memory and CPU change over time.

vmstat -s

Output:
    16384  total memory
    8000  used memory
    8384  active memory




3. htop
What it does: htop is like a colorful dashboard showing all the programs running in your toy factory. You can scroll, sort, or even stop programs using your keyboard!
How to Use
Start it with:
htop

What You See

Top: Bars for CPU, memory, and swap usage.
Bottom: List of processes (like firefox, bash) with their CPU and memory usage.
Use arrow keys to scroll, F9 to stop a process, or q to quit.

Flags

-u <user>
Show only processes for a specific user (e.g., htop -u bob).


-s <column>
Sort by a column (e.g., htop -s CPU).


-d <delay>
Set refresh delay in tenths of a second (e.g., -d 10 for 1 second).

Show only Bobâ€™s processes:
htop -u bob

Shows only programs Bob is running (like his games).

Refresh every 0.5 seconds:
htop -d 5




Note: Install with sudo apt install htop (Ubuntu).


4. sar
What it does: sar is like a time-traveling reporter that logs how your computerâ€™s CPU, memory, disk, and network were doing. Itâ€™s part of the sysstat package.

Note: Always needs sudo. Install with sudo apt install iotop (Ubuntu).


7. perf
What it does: perf is a scientist analyzing why programs are slow or using too much CPU. Itâ€™s great for finding performance problems.
How to Use
Measure a commandâ€™s performance:
sudo perf stat ls

Example Output
 Performance counter stats for 'ls':
          0.123456 ms task-clock
             1234 context-switches

Flags



Flag
Description



stat
Show performance stats for a command.


record
Record performance data.


report
Show a report from recorded data.


-g
Include call graph (function calls).


More Examples

Record a programâ€™s performance:
sudo perf record -g sleep 5
sudo perf report

Records sleep 5 and shows a detailed report.

Average over 3 runs:
sudo perf stat -r 3 ls




Note: Needs sudo. Install with sudo apt install linux-tools-common (Ubuntu).


Tips and Tricks

Mix and match: Open two terminals and run htop and iotop to see CPU and disk usage together.
Watch trends: Use sar -u 1 10 to monitor CPU for 10 seconds.
Customize dstat: Try dstat -cdngy --top-cpu for a full system overview.
Be careful with perf: Itâ€™s powerful but can generate big data files with record.

Have fun exploring your computerâ€™s toy factory! If you want more examples or help, just ask! ðŸ˜„
