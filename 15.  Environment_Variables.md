###  Environment Variables

## 🧠 What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are **like settings** that tell your Linux shell how to behave. They store things like:

* Where to find programs (`PATH`)
* Your home folder (`HOME`)
* Your username (`USER`)

They're used by the system and apps to run properly.

---

## 📘 1. `env` – See All Environment Variables

**👉 What it does:** Lists all environment variables currently active.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
env
```

**Output:**

```
HOME=/home/user
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
USER=myname
```

**💡 Use it to check your system's current settings.**

---

## 📘 2. `echo $VARIABLE` – See One Variable’s Value

**👉 What it does:** Shows the value of a specific variable.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
echo $HOME
```

**Output:**

```
/home/user
```

**💡 Tip:** `$` is used to access a variable's value.

---

## 📘 3. `export VARIABLE=value` – Set a Variable

**👉 What it does:** Creates or updates a variable and makes it available to child processes.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
export MY_NAME=John
echo $MY_NAME
```

**Output:**

```
John
```

**💡 Without `export`, the variable won't be available to scripts or child processes.**

---

## 📘 4. `alias newcommand='command'` – Create Command Shortcuts

**👉 What it does:** Makes a shortcut for a longer command.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
alias ll='ls -l'
```

Now you can type `ll` instead of `ls -l`.

**💡 To make it permanent, add it to `~/.bashrc`.**

---

## 📘 5. `echo $PATH` – Show Executable Search Paths

**👉 What it does:** Shows where the system looks for programs when you type a command.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
echo $PATH
```

**Output:**

```
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```

**💡 If a program isn't in one of these folders, Linux won't find it unless you use the full path.**

---

## 📘 6. `export PATH=$PATH:/new/path` – Add to PATH

**👉 What it does:** Adds a folder to your `PATH` so you can run scripts from it.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/scripts
```

Now you can run scripts in that folder just by typing their name.

**💡 To make it permanent, add that line to `~/.bashrc`.**

---

## 📘 7. `unset VARIABLE` – Remove a Variable

**👉 What it does:** Deletes an environment variable from the current session.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
unset MY_NAME
echo $MY_NAME
```

**Output:**

```
(blank)
```

**💡 Only affects the current terminal session.**

---

## 📘 8. `source ~/.bashrc` – Reload Your Shell Settings

**👉 What it does:** Re-applies changes made in `~/.bashrc` without restarting your terminal.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**💡 You can also use:**

```bash
. ~/.bashrc
```

Use this after adding variables or aliases to your `~/.bashrc`.

| `export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir` | Add a folder to the PATH          | `export PATH=$PATH:~/bin` |
| `unset VAR`                  | Remove a variable                 | `unset MY_VAR`            |
| `source ~/.bashrc`           | Reload `.bashrc` to apply changes | `source ~/.bashrc`        |

## 💡 Tips

* 🧠 Variables like `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, and `SHELL` are commonly used.
* 🖥 Add variables and aliases to `~/.bashrc` to make them permanent.
* 🔁 Always `source ~/.bashrc` after changing it.
* 🛡 Be careful when modifying `PATH`. Putting the wrong folder first could run unsafe programs.
