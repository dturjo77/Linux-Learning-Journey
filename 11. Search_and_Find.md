### 'Search and Find'

## ✅ 1. `locate filename`

**👉 What it does:**
Quickly finds files by name on your computer.

**💡 How it works:**
It searches in a **pre-built list (database)** of files. This list is updated using a command called `updatedb`.

**🧠 Remember:**
It’s **very fast** but may not find new files unless the database is updated.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
locate myfile.txt
```

**Output (Example):**

```
/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt
/usr/share/docs/myfile.txt
```

**📣 Note:**
If you just created `myfile.txt`, it may not show up until the database is updated with:

```bash
sudo updatedb
```

## ✅ 2. `whereis programname`

**👉 What it does:**
Finds the **executable**, **source code**, and **manual** of a program.

**💡 How it works:**
Looks in standard system folders like `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/share/man`, etc.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
whereis ls
```

**Output:**

```
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
```

**👀 Meaning:**

* `/bin/ls`: The actual `ls` command you use.
* `/usr/share/man/...`: The manual (help) file for it.

---

## ✅ 3. `which commandname`

**👉 What it does:**
Shows **where a command is located** in your system (from your `PATH` environment).

**💡 How it works:**
It checks the folders listed in `$PATH` and tells you where it found the first match.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
which python3
```

**Output:**

```
/usr/bin/python3
```

**🎯 Use Case:**
You can check which version of a program is being used when you have multiple installed.

## ✅ 4. `find / -mtime -n`

**👉 What it does:**
Finds files **modified in the last `n` days**.

**💡 How it works:**
Starts searching from `/` (root folder), looking for recently modified files.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
find / -mtime -2
```

**Meaning:**
Find all files changed in the **last 2 days**.

**⚠️ Caution:**
Searching from `/` takes time and may show permission denied errors. You can search a specific folder like:

```bash
find /home/yourname -mtime -2
```

---

## ✅ 5. `find / -perm -4000`

**👉 What it does:**
Finds files with **SUID permission** set (a special kind of permission).

**💡 What is SUID?**
It means: When a user runs the file, it runs with the **file owner's permissions**, not the user’s.

**📌 Example:**

```bash
find / -perm -4000
```

**Output Example:**

```
/usr/bin/passwd
```

**🛡️ Why it matters:**

* `passwd` lets users change their password, so it must run with root permissions.
* But misconfigured SUID files can be a **security risk**.

## ✅ Summary Table:

| Command              | What It Finds                         | Key Feature                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `locate file.txt`    | Any file by name                      | Super fast (uses a database) |
| `whereis ls`         | Program + manual + source             | Shows all related locations  |
| `which python3`      | Executable in `$PATH`                 | Shows which version will run |
| `find / -mtime -2`   | Recently modified files (last 2 days) | Real-time, more accurate     |
| `find / -perm -4000` | Files with SUID bit                   | Used for security audits     |
