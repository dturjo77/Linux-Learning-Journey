## 🔐 Security Tools in Linux – Made Easy

These tools help protect your system, find malware, check logs, and test security. Most require `sudo` (root access).

---

### 1. **`auditctl`** – Monitor File or System Changes

Tracks activity like file edits or access.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd-watch
```

👀 Tracks changes to `/etc/passwd` (write & attribute changes).

---

### 2. **`ausearch -f`** – Search Audit Logs

Finds audit log entries related to a file.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo ausearch -f /etc/passwd
```

🔍 Shows who accessed or changed `/etc/passwd`.

---

### 3. **`fail2ban-client status`** – Block Repeated Failed Logins

Stops attackers from brute-forcing services like SSH.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status
```

🛡️ See which services (jails) are protected and blocked IPs.

---

### 4. **`clamscan -r /path`** – Scan for Viruses

Finds viruses and malware using ClamAV.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo clamscan -r /home/user
```

🦠 Scans all files in `/home/user` for malware.

---

### 5. **`chkrootkit`** – Detect Rootkits

Checks your system for hidden malware.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo chkrootkit
```

🚨 Scans system files for known rootkits.

---

### 6. **`rkhunter --check`** – Scan for Rootkits & Exploits

Another tool like chkrootkit, checks configs and files.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
sudo rkhunter --check
```

🔍 Looks for suspicious changes or threats.

---

### 7. **`openssl`** – Work with Certificates & Encryption

Used for SSL certs, password hashes, encryption.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text
```

🔏 Shows certificate info from a file.

---

### 8. **`hashcat`** – Test Password Strength

Cracks password hashes to check how strong they are.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
```

🧠 Tries to crack MD5 hashes using a wordlist.

---

### 9. **`hydra`** – Brute-force Network Logins

Tests login forms for weak passwords (e.g., SSH, FTP).

📌 **Example**:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt ssh://192.168.1.1
```

🔓 Tries passwords for user `admin` on SSH.

---

### 10. **`metasploit`** – Penetration Testing Tool

Used to test system security by simulating real attacks.

📌 **Example**:

```bash
msfconsole
```

🎯 Starts the Metasploit tool for advanced testing.

---

## 📝 Final Tips

✅ Use **`sudo`** for most tools
✅ Only use hacking tools (**hydra, metasploit**) **legally**
✅ Keep tools **updated** to detect latest threats
✅ Check logs in `/var/log/` for security events
✅ Use **multiple tools** together for full protection
