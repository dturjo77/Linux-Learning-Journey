### File Permissions Commands

1. **chmod octal filename**  
   **Explanation**: Changes the permissions of a file using octal notation (e.g., 755, 644), where numbers represent permissions for owner, group, and others (read=4, write=2, execute=1).  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   chmod 644 myfile.txt
   ```
   **Output**: Sets `myfile.txt` permissions to `rw-r--r--` (owner: read/write, group/others: read-only).  
   **Use**: Restrict or grant access to a file, e.g., making a file readable by everyone but writable only by the owner.

2. **chown ownername filename**  
   **Explanation**: Changes the owner of a file to the specified user.  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   chown alice myfile.txt
   ```
   **Output**: Changes the owner of `myfile.txt` to user `alice`.  
   **Use**: Transfer ownership of a file to another user, e.g., for collaboration. (May require `sudo`.)

3. **chgrp groupname filename**  
   **Explanation**: Changes the group ownership of a file to the specified group.  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   chgrp developers myfile.txt
   ```
   **Output**: Changes the group of `myfile.txt` to `developers`.  
   **Use**: Assign a file to a specific group for shared access among group members.

4. **chmod -R octal directory**  
   **Explanation**: Changes permissions recursively for a directory and all its contents (files and subdirectories) using octal notation.  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 myfolder
   ```
   **Output**: Sets `myfolder` and all its contents to `rwxr-xr-x` (owner: read/write/execute, group/others: read/execute).  
   **Use**: Apply permissions to an entire directory tree, e.g., for a web server directory.

5. **chown -R ownername directory**  
   **Explanation**: Changes the owner of a directory and all its contents recursively.  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   chown -R alice myfolder
   ```
   **Output**: Changes the owner of `myfolder` and all its contents to user `alice`.  
   **Use**: Transfer ownership of an entire directory structure to another user. (May require `sudo`.)

6. **setfacl -m u:user:rwx filename**  
   **Explanation**: Sets Access Control List (ACL) permissions for a specific user on a file, allowing fine-grained access control (r=read, w=write, x=execute).  
   **Example**:  
   ```bash
   setfacl -m u:bob:rwx myfile.txt
   ```
   **Output**: Grants user `bob` read, write, and execute permissions on `myfile.txt`.  
   **Use**: Provide specific permissions to a user without changing the fileâ€™s standard permissions or ownership.

### Notes
- **Permissions**: Commands like `chown`, `chgrp`, and `setfacl` often require `sudo` for files/directories not owned by the current user.
- **Octal Notation**: For `chmod`, common values are:
  - `755`: Owner has full access (rwx), others have read/execute (r-x).
  - `644`: Owner has read/write (rw-), others have read (r--).
- **ACLs**: The `setfacl` command requires the ACL package to be installed and supported by the file system.
- **Caution**: Be careful with recursive commands (`-R`) as they affect all files and subdirectories. Always verify before running.
- **Checking Changes**: Use `ls -l` to verify permissions or `getfacl filename` to check ACLs after modification.
