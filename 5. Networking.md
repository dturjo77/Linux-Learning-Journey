### Notes
- **Permissions**: Commands like `tcpdump`, `iptables`, or `nmap` often require `sudo` for full functionality.
- **Installation**: Some tools (`nmap`, `wireshark`, `mtr`, `ufw`) may need to be installed (e.g., via `apt install nmap` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Caution**: Use `nmap` and `tcpdump` ethically and only on networks you have permission to scan or monitor.
