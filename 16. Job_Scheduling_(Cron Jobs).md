### Job Scheduling (Cron Jobs)

---

## 🕒 What Are Cron Jobs?

Cron jobs are **automated tasks** scheduled to run at specific times or intervals on Linux/Unix systems. They're powered by the **cron daemon**, which runs in the background.

Use them to:

* Run backups every night
* Send emails hourly
* Clean logs weekly
* Start services on reboot

---

## 🔧 Core Cron Commands & Concepts

### 📌 1. `crontab -l` – List Your Cron Jobs

Shows all jobs set up by **your user**.

**Example:**

```bash
crontab -l
```

**Output:**

```
* * * * * /home/user/script.sh
```

🕐 This means the script runs every minute.

---

### 📌 2. `crontab -e` – Edit Your Cron Jobs

Opens your personal cron job list in a text editor.

**Example Entry:**

```bash
0 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
```

🕑 This runs every day at 2:00 AM.

📌 Format:

```
minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command
```

Example:

```
30 4 * * 1    # Every Monday at 4:30 AM
```

---

### 📌 3. `crontab -r` – Remove All Cron Jobs

**⚠ Warning**: Deletes all your scheduled tasks **without confirmation**.

**Example:**

```bash
crontab -r
```

Run `crontab -l` after to confirm it's empty.

---

### 📌 4. `@reboot` – Run at Startup

Runs a command **once** at system boot.

**Add this to your crontab:**

```bash
@reboot /home/user/start-service.sh
```

🚀 Useful for launching servers, background tasks, or setting up the environment after a reboot.

---

### 📌 5. `systemctl status cron` – Check Cron Service

Checks if the cron daemon is running.

**Example:**

```bash
systemctl status cron
```

🟢 Output might say:

```
Active: active (running)
```

🛠 To start or enable:

```bash
sudo systemctl start cron
sudo systemctl enable cron
```

---

### 📌 6. `cat /etc/crontab` – View System-Wide Cron Jobs

Shows cron jobs for **all users**, not just yours.

**Example:**

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

**Output:**

```
0 3 * * * root /usr/sbin/logrotate
```

🧑‍💻 This runs `logrotate` as root daily at 3:00 AM.

📌 This file includes an extra **user field**:

```
minute hour dom month dow user command
```

## 🧠 Cron Syntax Cheatsheet

| Field        | Allowed Values | Description                  |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Minute       | 0–59           | Minute of the hour           |
| Hour         | 0–23           | Hour of the day              |
| Day of Month | 1–31           | Day of the month             |
| Month        | 1–12           | Month                        |
| Day of Week  | 0–7            | 0 or 7 = Sunday, 1 = Monday… |

🔹 **Example:** `15 14 1 * *` = Run at 2:15 PM on the 1st of every month.

🔹 **Special shortcuts:**

* `@hourly` → every hour
* `@daily`  → every day at midnight
* `@weekly` → every Sunday at midnight
* `@monthly` → on the 1st of every month
* `@reboot` → once, when the system starts

## 🛡 Best Practices

✅ Use **absolute paths** for commands and scripts
✅ Redirect output for debugging:

```bash
/path/to/script.sh > /tmp/log.txt 2>&1
```

✅ Use `crontab -e` for personal jobs, and edit `/etc/crontab` or `/etc/cron.d/` only if you're root.

✅ Test scripts **manually** before automating them.

✅ Use `crontab -l > backup.txt` to backup your jobs before deleting or modifying them.

## 📂 Where Cron Jobs Are Stored

| Location                    | Who it affects           | Edited with          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` | Per user                 | `crontab -e`         |
| `/etc/crontab`              | System-wide (needs root) | Manual edit          |
| `/etc/cron.d/`              | System-wide              | Separate job files   |
| `/etc/cron.daily/`          | Scripts run daily        | Just drop in scripts |
