# Linux Learning Journey

Welcome to my daily log of learning Linux command-line fundamentals! This repository documents my progress as I explore Linux navigation, file management, permissions, and more, using resources like *The Linux Command Line* book and TryHackMe's `Linux Fundamentals` course. Each day includes learning objectives, tasks, practice exercises, and reflections.

## Goals
- Master basic Linux commands and file system navigation.
- Build practical skills through hands-on tasks in a Kali Linux VM.
- Document progress to reinforce learning and share with the community.

## Progress
- [Day 1: Basic Linux Navigation](Day1_Basic_Linux_Navigation.md) - Covers commands: ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv
- [Day 2: Networking](Day2_Networking.md) -  Covers commands: ping, traceroute, ip, netstat, mtr, host, dig, whois, arp-scan, nmap, tcpdump, wireshark, route, ss
