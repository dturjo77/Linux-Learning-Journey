# Linux Learning Journey

Welcome to my daily log of learning Linux command-line fundamentals! This repository documents my progress as I explore Linux navigation, file management, permissions, and more, using resources like *The Linux Command Line* book and TryHackMe's "Linux Fundamentals" course. Each day includes learning objectives, tasks, practice exercises, and reflections.

## Goals
- Master basic Linux commands and file system navigation.
- Build practical skills through hands-on tasks in a Kali Linux VM.
- Document progress to reinforce learning and share with the community.

## Progress
- [Day 1: Basic Linux Navigation](Day1_Basic_Linux_Navigation.md) - ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv

## Resources
- *The Linux Command Line* by William Shotts
- [TryHackMe: Linux Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com)
- Kali Linux Virtual Machine
